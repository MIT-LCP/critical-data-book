# Chapter 19. Instrumental Variable Analysis of Electronic Health Records

This directory contains the code used in the following publication:

Penna N. D. *et al.* **Instrumental Variable Analysis of Electronic Health Records**, in *Secondary analysis of Electronic Health Record Data*, Springer.

## Summary of Publication

Sources of variation in treatments received that are exogenous to patients can be used to estimate causal effects from observational data. We present an example of this methodology that estimates the effect of critically ill patients being cared for in “non-target ICUs” due to capacity constraints - a process known as *boarding*.

## Replicating this Publication

The work presented in this case study can be replicated using the attached files. 

* `icu_boarders.py`: Extraction and pre-processing of data from the MIMIC database using Python.

* `analysis_main.Rmd` : Statistical analysis using R.
