# Chapter 26. Waveform Analysis to Estimate Respiratory Rate

This directory contains the code and algorithms used in the following publication:

Charlton P.H. *et al.* [**Waveform analysis to estimate respiratory rate**](http://peterhcharlton.github.io/RRest/waveform_analysis.html), in *Secondary analysis of Electronic Health Record Data*, Springer, [Under Review]

Code is provided for extraction of waveform data from the MIMIC II database in Matlab &reg; format. 
The algorithms for estimation of respiratory rate are also in Matlab &reg; format.

## Summary of Publication

Several techniques have been developed for estimation of respiratory rate (RR) from physiological waveforms.
This case study presents a comparison of exemplary techniques for estimation of RR from the electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) waveforms.
Both the database and code used to evaluate the techniques are publicly available, equipping the reader with tools to develop and test their own RR algorithms for estimation of RR from physiological waveforms.

## Replicating this Publication

The work presented in this case study can be replicated as follows:

*   Ensure that you have the WFDB Toolbox for Matlab installed. Installation instructions are available [here](https://archive.physionet.org/physiotools/matlab/wfdb-app-matlab/).
*   Download the code for the book from [here](https://github.com/MIT-LCP/critical-data-book/archive/master.zip). Extract the files by unzipping the directory. Navigate to the _part_iii/chapter26/_ directory.
*   You will also need [`rpeakdetect.m`](http://www.mit.edu/~gari/CODE/ECGtools/ecgBag/rpeakdetect.m), which is covered by the [GNU General Public Licence](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html). Download this file and save it in the _Algorithms_ directory.
*   Locate the [_MIMICII_data_importer.m_](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peterhcharlton/RRest/master/RRest_v1.0/Data_Import_Scripts/MIMICII_data_importer.m) script contained within the _Data_Import_Scripts_ directory. Modify the _universal parameters_ specified within this script (starting on line 64) to choose the directories where data should be stored.
*   Run the _MIMICII_data_importer.m_ script to download data from the MIMIC II dataset. Note that the data will total approximately 14 GB, so this will require sufficient disk space and may take some time. This will create a file called _mimicii_data.mat_ containing the data.
*   Locate the [_setup_universal_params.m_](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MIT-LCP/critical-data-book/master/section3/chapter10/RRest_v1.0/Algorithms/setup_universal_params.m) script. Modify the file paths (starting at line 36) so that the script can find the _mimicii_data.mat_ file by ensuring that the _up.paths.root_folder_ on line 50 of this scipt has the same path as the _up.paths.data_save_folder_ on line 77 of the _MIMICII_data_importer.m_ script.
*   Perform the analysis using Version 1 of the _RRest_ toolbox of algorithms contained within this directory. To perform the analysis call the main script using the following command: *RRest('mimicii')*
*   The results are provided in a spreadsheet at _...\mimicii\Analysis_files\Results\Tables\stats_results_table_adult.xls_ . These are the results reported in Table 2. If you wish to reproduce Table 1, then run _MIMICII_data_importer.m_ with a breakpoint at line 475, and see the results contained within the _extraction_stats_ variable. Note that you can comment out line 46 of this script when running it for a second time to avoid downloading the data again.

## Further Resources

The accompanying [Wiki](https://github.com/peterhcharlton/RRest/wiki) acts as a user manual for the _RRest_ algorithms presented in this repository.

For those interested in estimating respiratory rate from physiological signals, the wider [Respiratory Rate Estimation project](http://peterhcharlton.github.io/RRest/), of which this is a part, will be of interest. It also contains additional material such as data to use with the algorithms, publications arising from the project, and details of how to contribute.
